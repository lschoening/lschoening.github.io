    "section": "",
    "text": "The Broncos took their chance on a man who had not yet had a chance to start in the NFL, Drew Lock. He showed the NFL league what he could do for two seasons before being traded by the Broncos. Could the Broncos do any better, or should they have given Drew more of a chance?\nThe Broncos could do better…\nThe next man for the job was someone who brought hope for most Broncos fans, Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks. He had a major year before the Broncos brought him onto the lineup, but would he be better for the Broncos?\nMaybe he would be but maybe not.\nTo find out who was better for the Broncos we will look at some statistics in many areas of the game and find out who in fact has a shot at leading the team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nqbs22 <- read_csv(\"quarterbacks22.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022) %>% filter(Pos == \"QB\" | Pos == \"qb\" ) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Player)) %>% rename(PassYds = `Yds...12`)\n\nqbs21 <- read_csv(\"quarterbacks21.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021) %>% filter(Pos == \"QB\" | Pos == \"qb\" ) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Player)) %>% rename(PassYds = `Yds...12`)\n\nqbs <- bind_rows(qbs22, qbs21) \n\ndrew <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player == \"Drew Lock\")\nruss <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=qbs21, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=drew, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(data=russ, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"blue\") +  \n  geom_smooth(data=qbs21, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=drew, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds, label= Player))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=russ, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds, label= Player))+\n  labs(\ntitle= \"Passing Yards by Good Quarterback's vs Bad\",\n  subtitle = \"Drew Lock and Russell Wilson have not made it easy for the Broncos\",\n    caption = \"Source Sports Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Cmp\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Broncos fan knows that the last few seasons have been a major struggle not only as a team as a whole but having the quarterback to support the team.

Some are on the smaller side while others on a higher, it may surprise you. Who do you think had the most touchdowns?\nIt was definetly not Drew Lock that’s for sure.\n\n\nCode\ntop10td <- qbs21 %>% top_n(10,wt= TD)\ntoptentdplus <- bind_rows(top10td,drew,russ)\n\n\nNew names:\nNew names:\nNew names:\n• `Yds...26` -> `Yds`\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=toptentdplus, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player,TD), x=TD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"orange\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\nlabs(\n  title = \"Touchdowns Vs Interseptions\",\n  subtitle = \"Some Players Can Sucsesfully Complete More Passes\",\n  caption = \"Source Sports Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n  x = \"TD vs Int\",\n  y = \"\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly we will find out who can overall do their job. We will look at touchdowns and intersections by each player and compare them.\nDoes this bring any surprises for you?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Alex Gordon is loved in Nebraska, but does that mean he’s as good as Nebraskans make him out to be? Alex is so well known setting records at UNL as well as awards in the MLB receiving the Golden Glove Award eight times, the Fielding Bible Award four times, and the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award one time.\nAlex was the fifth pick in the MLB draft he was picked up by the Royals and continued his whole career with them. There were times when he dropped down to the triple A league team the Storm Chasers. Here he was greeted with love and support until he went back to the Royals.\nOverall he is a well rounded player succeeding in infield and outfield but there was never any key moments in the MLB that truly made him stand out. That leads to the question if it’s because he’s an outfielder or was there nothing other then him being from Nebraska that makes him stand out to us.Should be belong in the Hall of Fame or is he just a famous name?\nThree graphs have been put together to see if he really does stand out. These statics will show him and the rest of the MLB players. Some similar to him others not.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\ncareer<- read_csv(\"Career.csv\")\nalltime <- read_csv(\"alltime.csv\")\nallhits <- read_csv(\"allhitters2011.csv\")\nteamfield <- read_csv(\"TeamFielding.csv\")\n\nalex <- alltime %>% filter(Players == \"Alex Gordon\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=alltime, aes(x=reorder(Players, WAR), weight=WAR)) +\n  geom_bar(data=alex, aes(x=reorder(Players, WAR), weight=WAR),fill= \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n  title = \"Alex Is Hard To Replace\",\n  subtitle = \"How Truly Valuable He Is For The Royals\",\n  caption = \"Baseball Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n  x = \"\",\n  y = \"WAR\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWAR stands for Wins Above Replacement. His value in all areas of the game puts him at a pretty average spots when it comes to the chance of a replacement level player stepping in. In this graph there are some of the most known names the Royals have had on their team. George Brett clearly stands out but when looking at this graph Alex is in a solid middle spot showing his value pretty clear.\n\n\nCode\nhits <- allhits %>% \nfilter(\n  AB > 200\n)\nalexhits <- hits %>% filter(Name == \"Alex Gordon\")\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data=hits, aes(x=H, y=RBI), color = \"light grey\") +\ngeom_point(data=alexhits, aes(x=H, y=RBI), color= \"blue\") +\ngeom_encircle(data=alexhits, aes(x=H-.10, y=RBI), s_shape=.2, expand=.012, color=\"blue\") + \ngeom_smooth(data=hits, aes(x=H, y=RBI), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"dark grey\") +\ngeom_text_repel(data=alexhits, aes(x=H, y=RBI, label= Name)) +\nlabs(\ntitle= \" Gordon Compared To All Of MLB\",\n  subtitle = \" How many Hits Have led to RBI's \",\n    caption = \"Baseball Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"RBI\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows all batters in the 2011 season, how many of their hits led to an RBI. Alex is higher on this list showing almost 200 hit. He is above average and this represents that he is a sucssesful hitter, making him a key batter on the Royals lineup.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\nfield <- teamfield %>% \nfilter(\n    G > 20 & \n      Inn > 40 & \n      is.na(Name) == FALSE) %>%\n  filter(Lg == \"AL\")\n\nag <- field %>% filter(Name == \"Alex Gordon\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=field, aes(y=Tm, x=`RF/9`), groupOnX=FALSE, color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=ag, aes(y=Tm, x=`RF/9`), groupOnX=FALSE, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_encircle(data=ag, aes(x=`RF/9`-.2, y=Tm), s_shape=.02, expand=.001, colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=ag, aes(x=`RF/9`, y=Tm, label= Name)) +\n  labs(\ntitle= \" Alex Godrons Impact while In The Field\",\n  subtitle = \"Outs Completed\",\n    caption = \"Baseball Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Tm\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where things start to get interesting. Here is all of the MLB players and the number of outs and assists they have had per nine innings. Alex is on the lower side for the Royals but still is not in a bad position compared to other players on his team."
