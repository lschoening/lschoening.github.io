    "section": "",
    "text": "The Broncos took their chance on a man who had not yet had a chance to start in the NFL, Drew Lock. He showed the NFL league what he could do for two seasons before being traded by the Broncos. Could the Broncos do any better, or should they have given Drew more of a chance?\nThe Broncos could do better…\nThe next man for the job was someone who brought hope for most Broncos fans, Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks. He had a major year before the Broncos brought him onto the lineup, but would he be better for the Broncos?\nMaybe he would be but maybe not.\nTo find out who was better for the Broncos we will look at some statistics in many areas of the game and find out who in fact has a shot at leading the team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nqbs22 <- read_csv(\"quarterbacks22.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022) %>% filter(Pos == \"QB\" | Pos == \"qb\" ) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Player)) %>% rename(PassYds = `Yds...12`)\n\nqbs21 <- read_csv(\"quarterbacks21.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021) %>% filter(Pos == \"QB\" | Pos == \"qb\" ) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Player)) %>% rename(PassYds = `Yds...12`)\n\nqbs <- bind_rows(qbs22, qbs21) \n\ndrew <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player == \"Drew Lock\")\nruss <- qbs21 %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=qbs21, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=drew, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(data=russ, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), color=\"blue\") +  \n  geom_smooth(data=qbs21, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=drew, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds, label= Player))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=russ, aes(x=Cmp, y=PassYds, label= Player))+\n  labs(\ntitle= \"Passing Yards by Good Quarterback's vs Bad\",\n  subtitle = \"Drew Lock and Russell Wilson have not made it easy for the Broncos\",\n    caption = \"Source Sports Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Cmp\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Broncos fan knows that the last few seasons have been a major struggle not only as a team as a whole but having the quarterback to support the team. As any team knows the quarterback is what makes the game go round, so how bad have the last two Broncos quarterback been?\nThey have been bad… very bad.\n\n\nCode\ntopten <- qbs21 %>% top_n(10,wt=TD)\ntoptenplus <- bind_rows(topten,drew,russ)\n\n\nNew names:\nNew names:\nNew names:\n• `Yds...26` -> `Yds`\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\ngeom_bar(data=toptenplus, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD)) +\ngeom_bar(data=drew, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD),fill= \"orange\") +\ngeom_bar(data=russ, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD), fill= \"blue\") +\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(\n  title = \"The Great Vs The Terrible\",\n  subtitle = \"Drew and Russell Compared to the Well Known Quarterbacks\",\n  caption = \"Source Sports Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n  x = \"\",\n  y = \"Total TD\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLets look at the amount of touchdowns these quarterbacks have had. Some are on the smaller side while others on a higher, it may surprise you. Who do you think had the most touchdowns?\nIt was definetly not Drew Lock that’s for sure.\n\n\nCode\ntop10td <- qbs21 %>% top_n(10,wt= TD)\ntoptentdplus <- bind_rows(top10td,drew,russ)\n\n\nNew names:\nNew names:\nNew names:\n• `Yds...26` -> `Yds`\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=toptentdplus, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player,TD), x=TD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"orange\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\nlabs(\n  title = \"Touchdowns Vs Interseptions\",\n  subtitle = \"Some Players Can Sucsesfully Complete More Passes\",\n  caption = \"Source Sports Reference | By Lauren Schoening\",\n  x = \"TD vs Int\",\n  y = \"\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly we will find out who can overall do their job. We will look at touchdowns and intersections by each player and compare them.\nDoes this bring any surprises for you?"
